Yohohoho, Yohohoho
Yohohoho, Yohohoho
Yohohoho, Yohohoho
Yohohoho, Yohohoho

Making a delivery, bringing it across the sea
Bink's sake in the hold as we sail through the breeze
Far across the eye can see, the sun is shining merrily
As the birds fly in the sky as they sing out with glee
Bid adieu to weaverâ€™s town! Say so long to port renowned!
Sailing on from dusk 'til dawn and singing out as one
Cross the gold and silver waves, changing into water sprays
Sailing out on our journey to the ends of the sea!

Yohohoho, Yohohoho
Yohohoho, Yohohoho
Yohohoho, Yohohoho
Yohohoho, Yohohoho

Making a delivery of Bink's sake through the sea
Let be shown that we are known as pirates, sailing free
Time to raise the flag up high, of jolly roger in the sky
Raise the sails and tell the tales that never pass you by
Somewhere in the endless sky, a storm has started coming by
Waves a-dancing, sails a-prancing through the wind and rain
If we let blow winds of fear, then the end of us is near
Even so, tomorrow the sun will rise again.

Yohohoho, Yohohoho
Yohohoho, Yohohoho
Yohohoho, Yohohoho
Yohohoho, Yohohoho

Making a delivery of Bink's sake through the sea
Through today, and through tomorrow, all your dreams will lay
Say goodbye should we depart, and keep your memories in your heart
Don't you frown and don't be down, but live to sieze the day
Making a delivery of Bink's sake through the sea
Sailing on from dusk 'til dawn and singing out as one
After all is said and done, we all end up as skeletons
Tales unending, rules a-bending, journey just begun!

Yohohoho, Yohohoho
Yohohoho, Yohohoho
Yohohoho, Yohohoho
